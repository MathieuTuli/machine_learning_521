# Inference Algorithms and Machine Learning
500 Level graduate course from the Universit of Toronto I took in my third year of
undergraduate studies. This repositor holds code for the three TensorFlow assignments
that were part of the course. The assignments were completed with two other students ().

**This is my first ever experience developing machine learning models and using TensorFlow**

## Assignments
- Assignment 1
    - K-Nearest Neighbor
- Assignment 2
    - Linear and Logistic Regression
- Assignment 3
    - Neural Networks
